========================HOW TO EXECUTE THIS PROGRAM
========================



java -jar AIW2019_P3_G12.jar


To make things easier, we implemented a dynamic path of gate home, path of gapp and path of twitter plugin to set it via terminal, so we need to put the path as follows:

PS W:\023\u124320\Documents\AIW-2019-P3-G12> java -jar AIW-2019-P3-G12.jar
Please enter your Gate-Home (variable) path: 
C:\Program Files\GATE_Developer_8.0
Please enter your gapp path: 
\\dcloud.local\public\023\u124320\Documents\NetBeansProjects\AIW2019_P3_G12\gapp\MyTwitter.gapp
Please enter your twitter plugin path: 
C:\Program Files\GATE_Developer_8.0\plugins\Twitter

(You can put a relative or absolute path)


And press Enter!

We have an intuitive menu for the user to know what will do at all times)
